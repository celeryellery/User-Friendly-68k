		<p align="left"><b>What is Bookit?</b><br>Bookit is a free textbook resale service created by students, for students. You can sell your old textbooks to students on your campus, or you can browse used books that students from your school are selling. </p>
		<br>
		<p align="left"><b>Why was Bookit created?</b><br>Bookit was created by a team of students at the University of Washington Bothell. Just like you, we were tired of paying high prices for textbooks that we used for a few weeks, only to find that their resale value was only a fraction of the original price. We wanted an easy way to communicate with other students who might need our old books and who might be able offer used books of their own. </p>
		<br>
		<p align="left"><b>How do I find a book?</b><br>First, <a href="NewAccount.html">create an account</a> with Bookit. Then check out our <a href="MainPage.html">homepage</a>. You can search for a book by its full title, author’s full name, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number">ISBN</a>. Please be sure to enter the full title or author’s full name exactly as it appears on the book, with correct spelling. Searching by course number is not available at this time, but we hope to add this feature soon!</p>
		<br>
		<p align="left"><b>I found the book I want to buy. What now?</b><br>Awesome! Bookit makes it easy for you to contact the student selling the book: you can find the seller's email (or other preferred contact info) on the book’s information page. You and the seller can decide when and where you want to meet to exchange the book and the payment.</p>
		<br>
		<p align="left"><b>How do I post a book for sale?</b><br>First, <a href="NewAccount.html">create an account</a> with Bookit. Then check out our <a href="MainPage.html">homepage</a>. Click the "+" button in the upper right-hand corner, and enter the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number">ISBN</a> for your book. Bookit will attempt to fill out the rest of the information for you. If your book cannot be found, you may need to enter the remaining information yourself. Please be sure to double-check all information; if you don’t enter it correctly, buyers might not be able to find your book! You can choose the price you want for your book. Consider checking out other popular booksellers, like your campus book store, to make sure you price your book competitively. </p>
		<br>
		<p align="left"><b>How do I find my book's ISBN?</b><br>A book's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number">ISBN</a>, or International Standard Book Number, is a 10- or 13-digit number that is unique to that book alone. The ISBN can usually be found on the back cover of a book, directly above the bar code, and will often start with 978 or 979. Please enter the full ISBN, without dashes, including all trailing zeroes. Need more help? Check out our <a href="ISBNhelp.html">ISBN help page</a>.</p>
		<br>
		<p align="left"><b>Someone wants to buy my book. Now what?</b><br>That’s great! Communicate with the buyer to choose a time and place to meet. Consider choosing a public location on your school’s campus to ensure safety and convenience for everyone. Make sure to specify what form of payment is acceptable to you: cash, check, money order, etc. Don’t forget to bring your book to the meeting!</p>
